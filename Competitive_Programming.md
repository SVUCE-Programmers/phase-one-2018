TL;DR
[One stop bookmark for Competitive Programming](https://github.com/lnishan/awesome-competitive-programming) <br/>
You are in the jungle. You have a pocket-knife. Someone asks you to kill a mountain lion.

Years of training has taught you well. You use your knife to sharpen a stick. You cut vines to lash sharp stones on one end. Maybe you're from a top university, and you've learned to extract essential ingredients from plant and insect life around you to fashion a poison to tip your weapon with. 

Convinced that you have an effective and efficient way to kill the lion, you set forth to accomplish your task. Maybe your stick is too short, or your poisons don't work. It's okay - you live to refine your method and try again another day.

That's "real-life" programming.

In competitive programming, you start out with the same resources (a pocket-knife), except you have 2 minutes to kill the lion. [Source](https://www.quora.com/How-is-competitive-programming-different-from-real-life-programming)
#### 1. World of competitive programming
[What is ACM ICPC](https://icpc.baylor.edu/): <br/>
The ACM ICPC is considered as the “Olympics of Programming Competitions”. It is quite simply, the oldest, largest, and most prestigious programming contest in the world.

#### 2. Algorithms and how to learn them
Well, Introduction to Algorithm by CLRS is considered as the bible for Algorithms.
#### 3. Mathematics for coding
Just revise Linear Algebra, Combinatorics (Kenneth's DMS) and every 1 out of 2 will require atleast high school maths to solve.
#### 4. Standard Template Library in C++
