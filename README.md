# Phase one 2018
Coding club schedule, resources, activities for 2018

## Vision:
To make SVUCE students standout in national and world competitions / hackathon with multi-disciplinary projects, research in a fun, interactive way and collaborative with other departments of Sri Venkateswara University.

## Mission:
To give students the ability to implement their technical ideas, give freshmen students overview of computer science and programming, and organizing workshops or sessions on competitive programming, GSoC, ACM-ICPC, etc.

## Activities:
Every Thursday, all club members come together to participate in some activities like Mock Interviews, Technical presentations, Distinguished Speakers Lectures, open source awareness, freshmen orientation sessions, tech weekends, math-a-thons and <br>
Saturday activities like online quizzes, competitive coding, small projects, assignments, leveraging platforms like hackerank, spoj, codechef, interviewbit, leetcode, etc.
